List of features / ideas slated for future CleanTxt releases
============================================================

Immediate / short term goals
----------------------------

* Implement proper support for 16-bit Unicode, and properly account for
  multi-byte UTF-8 characters. This would be selectable through command
  line options, and can also allow conversion between 16-bit Unicode and
  plain 7-bit ASCII (since some Microsoft Windows installations of
  Notepad seem to default to 16-bit Unicode now, which can be
  frustrating if you use another platform that is not configured to
  handle these files).

* As with the GNU textutils "expand" program, allow arbitrary tab stops
  to be specified (user gives a comma-separated list of column numbers
  as a command-line argument).

* Write a minimal replacement stub for Check (the unit-testing suite,
  http://check.sourceforge.net) so I can run the unit tests on DJGPP.
  Currently the unit testing suite can only be run via GNU Autotools on
  Linux.
