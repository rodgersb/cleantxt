CleanTxt version change history
===============================

Version 1.0.1  (30/11/2013)
---------------------------

This is actually a formal packaging-together of the program, of which I
originally wrote 14 years ago. I've refactored the code, added unit test
suites (so I can improve future functionality and still ensure that the
program won't corrupt data) and written proper documentation.

I originally wrote CleanTxt as a Turbo Pascal program back in 1999 (when
I was still using MS-DOS/Windows 9x). In 2001, after moving to Linux, I
ported it to Free Pascal, then in 2003 rewrote it in C (as an exercise
for learning GNU Autotools).

Prior to being hosted on GitHub (this is also a means of giving me a
chance to acquaint and evaluate GitHub),  I either usually just gave out
copies of CleanTxt to work colleagues or other people informally.
